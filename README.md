Grammar and Exercieses for Seumas Macdonald's fantastic [LGPSI](https://seumasjeltzz.github.io/LinguaeGraecaePerSeIllustrata/)

# About the exercises

These exercises are in the style of Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrate (LLPSI). Each LLPSI chapter has three *pensum* which seem to have specific goals.

|Exercise| Goal |
|--------|----- |
|Pensum A| Fill in the correct ending |
|Pensum B| Fill in the correct word|
|Pensum C | Answer question based on the reading |

Thus each chapter should include exercises that fulfil the same goals as the sections in LLPSI.

|Exercise| Goal| Example |
|--------|-----|--------|
|μελετήμα 'Α | Complete the word with the correct prefix/sufix| ἡ Σπάρτη πόλις Ελληνιστ-- ἑστιν|
|μελετήμα 'Β | Fill in the correct word in the correct form | ἡ Σπάρτη πόλις -- ἑστιν. |
|μελετήμα 'Γ | Answer a question based on the reading | τὶς ἑστιν ἡ Σπάρτη;|

*An important principle is that each question should ideally include only one new thing.* This pacing is one of the things that sets LLPSI apart from other Greek courses and we would like to duplicate it here.

## Thoughts on building questions

1. Follow the schema above.
2. Read through the chapter of LGPSI and identify new words, endings, and sentences. Mark those in some way.
3. Draft questions that ask about those things and group them into the three sections.

Currently I'm reading through the chapter and bolding the new things. Then I copy the sentence I want to use to build a question from LGPSI (to save typing and messing up accents). For word completion questions, I'm using `--` to mark the blank in the word. For questions that ask the reader to supply the whole word I mark the blank with `---`.
