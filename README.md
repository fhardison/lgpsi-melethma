Grammar and Exercieses for Seumas Macdonald's fantastic [LGPSI](https://seumasjeltzz.github.io/LinguaeGraecaePerSeIllustrata/)

# About the exercises

These exercises are in the style of Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrate (LLPSI). Each LLPSI chapter has three *pensum* which seem to have specific goals.

|Exercise| Goal |
|--------|----- |
|Pensum A| Fill in the correct ending |
|Pensum B| Fill in the correct word| 
|Pensum C | Answer question based on the reading |

Thus each chapter should include exercises that fulfil the same goals as the sections in LLPSI.

|Exercise| Goal| Example |
|--------|-----|--------|
|μελετήμα 'Α | Complete the word with the correct prefix/sufix| ἡ Σπάρτη πόλις Ελληνιστ-- ἑστιν| 
|μελετήμα 'Β | Fill in the correct word in the correct form | ἡ Σπάρτη πόλις -- ἑστιν. |
|μελετήμα 'Γ | Answer a question based on the reading | τὶς ἑστιν ἡ Σπάρτη;|

*An important principle is that each question should ideally include only one new thing.* This pacing is one of the things that sets LLPSI apart from other Greek courses and we would like to duplicate it here.
